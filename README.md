# BCoB-IDE
Cobol IDE made in [purebasic](https://www.purebasic.com/)

I'm using [OpenCobolIDE](http://opencobolide.readthedocs.io/) with the cobol compiler [GnuCOBOL](https://sourceforge.net/projects/open-cobol/).

It's a very good IDE, but I always need more, so I've just started to program an IDE for Cobol only ;)

For the editor, I'm using [Scintilla](http://www.scintilla.org/)

For the font, I'm using "IBM 3270", you can find it here: https://github.com/rbanffy/3270font

## Last try after 2 days
Yes, there is a ruler :D
