# BCoB-IDE
Cobol IDE made in purebasic www.purebasic.com

I'm using OpenCobolIDE, it's a very good IDE, but I always need more, so I just started to program an IDE for Cobol only ;)

For the editor, I'm using scintilla

And, yes, there is a ruler :D

For the font, I'm using "IBM 3270", you can find it here: https://github.com/rbanffy/3270font
